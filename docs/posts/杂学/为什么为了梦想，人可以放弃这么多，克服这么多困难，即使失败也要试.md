本文是讲讲我怎么理解这个视频，为什么反复观看，反复被触动。本文借助了 Gemini 辅助创作，他根据我的视频笔记和视频转录文件并结合我的修改后，被写出。

有些谈话你看过一次便心生感激，而另一些则似乎还会一次又一次地呼唤你回来，每一次观看都能揭示出新的意义层面。陈老师在“怪兽部落破界大会”上的演讲对我来说，就坚定地属于后者。它不仅仅是一场演讲；它是一面映照我自身旅程的镜子，一个在我迷失时的指南针，一个强有力的提醒，让我记起自己选择背后的“为什么”，尤其是在我做出那些艰难且不被理解的选择时。这不仅仅是观看一个视频；这是关于重新连接到一个忠于自我生活的根本真理。

**书写自己故事的勇气：喜欢那个敢于尝试的“我”**

陈老师开篇就提到了他自己离开学校工作的“英勇时刻”，这个故事显然激励了很多人，有些人甚至因此辞职！这让我想：“其实假如我几年后相对成功了，那么我回顾，我现在追求梦想的，这段经历的话，我肯定会觉得自己当时很英勇，不是因为真成功了，这只是很小的因素，最重要的是，那个是一个在追求梦想的自己，我喜欢这样的自己。”这深深地触动了我。这个在不确定性中努力、学习和构建的“我”，是一个我想去支持和赞扬的“我”。当我反思时，我意识到，“**🎇 我做成的事情就是我的故事**”。我希望它是一个积极追求的叙事。

**忘记“为什么”的危险与“值得”之路的召唤**

演讲接着深入探讨了一位朋友的创业困境，他在因承诺未兑现和不公待遇而离职后感到迷茫。他被“如果当初”的想法和一大笔钱的损失所困扰。陈老师尖锐地问他：“你当时**为什么**出来?” 那位朋友的回答是关于想要创造价值，需要自由，像乔布斯或马斯克那样。这就引出了一个至关重要的洞见：“**🎇 一个人最大的迷失就是忘了自己的故事**，忘了自己的故事,他就会忘了自己为什么出发。”

这直击我心。当道路是“一条又独特又难的路”时，怀疑就会悄然而至。一位同学提出的问题，“如果你离开了学校以后，没有挣那么多的钱，然后也发展的没有原来那个好，你会不会后悔?” 我看到时也停下来思考了，我想，其实我当下是很难预料未来的，如果采用我走这条路和我之前的选择其实没什么区别，或者说我走这条路真的就失败了，而且还沉默了很多成本，到那一步时，我会不会后悔？。

但陈老师巧妙地重塑了这个问题：我们选择的“不是一条简单的更快成功的捷径”，而是一条“不一样的道路”。这就像选择去耶路撒冷而不是罗马——不是问哪条路更快，而是问哪条路“**更值得走**”。这是对你道路的信仰。

驱动力是什么？“**🎇 正是因为我们有一个想要成为的自己,我们才会去忍受痛苦,损失,挑战,才会不断不断的去追求这些东西。**” 这种“纯粹的动机”是基石。

另外，稻盛和夫决定搞 DDI 前也是问了自己很久，然后就有了纯粹的动机。其实如果我们心中有一个想要成为的自己，那就是纯粹的动机。《干法》里面的推荐序，有这么一句很诱惑人的话，我经常会回想它，“天道酬勤。只要热爱工作，只要抱着纯粹的动机、强烈的愿望，付出不亚于任何人的努力，就能感动上帝，获得天助。因为这种态度符合天道，与天地宇宙的意志相一致”。这当然不能概括出成功的条件，但已经概括了很多重要的条件。

**重新定义自由：我的选择，我的价值观**

那么，什么是真正的自由呢？陈老师给出了一个深刻的定义：“自由的本质就是你从旧有的评价体系，从那大众认为的评价体系解脱出来，转为你认为什么事情是重要，而你的选择给你的认为重要的事情加了码。” 这就是解放。

他用电影《千年女優》中的故事阐释了这一点：女主角明知她的追寻可能徒劳无功，却在踏上危险旅程时宣称：“**因为我喜欢那个追求爱情的自己**。” 这一点很戳我：“🎇 我选择到宇宙深处找我的恋人，最根本的不是因为我要找到他……**我去做这种行为是因为我喜欢那个追求爱情的自己，不管我结果有没有找到，我都要这么做**。” 它改变了我自己内心的叙述：“**我这么做是因为我真正的想这么做，我喜欢那样的我，那样追求自己梦想的我，即使很大概率失败，我都会这么做。**”，对比过去的我，我会用“我不这么做，我会不甘心，我一定要尝试”来去说服自己，对比之下，发现千年女优这种角度更靠近人的初心，也更有力量

讲《千年女優》的时候，陈老师还用张嘉豪的例子来开了个玩笑，“我一直想问张嘉豪老师一个问题,你做的是不是同款咒语啊”🤣。我查了张嘉豪的故事后，他那种执着太离谱了，不中咒语的话怎么解释能这么坚持。所以这就是一种榜样的力量，一种精神力量，活生生的力量，生活中，或世界上其实有很多这种榜样和力量，只要去用心看和想

> 补充：简单介绍一下单板滑雪运动员张嘉豪。
> 他原本是五星级酒店实习面点师，17 岁接触滑雪后便深深爱上。26 岁萌生参加北京冬奥会的梦想，作为非国家队运动员，他为获得冬奥会 “入场券”，在过去两年辗转全球比赛挣积分，虽无专业医疗保障团队和教练，仍独自坚持。但因疫情影响，最终未能完成积分要求。不过，他凭借对滑雪的热爱，成为冬奥会滑雪项目解说员，其 “接地气” 又具 “沉浸感” 的解说词令人印象深刻。

**追逐本身就是内在的回报**

视频中还讲到一位同学，他尽管屡次考试失败，面临为了舒适选择放弃梦想的选择，即使她更喜欢焦虑但充满希望和活力的自己。陈老师的建议是：“那就追求那个你喜欢的自己。**因为希望和活力本身就是回报**。” 这太对了。努力、学习、挑战自我边界的过程——那种能量，那种鲜活和投入的感觉，本身就是一种回报，无论是否立即“成功”。

**你最伟大的作品：你度过的时光**

最后那个经历人生跌宕起伏的企业家的故事的分享也很有意思，且深度足够。他说：“**其实我的事业,我的公司,我的挣的钱都不算事...我最好的作品是我度过的时光。**” 陈老师指出，这是只有那些曾“为自己想要成为的自己”而努力过的人才能说出的话。我自己对此的反应是：“无敌了！...这真的可以解决很多的焦虑纠结低迷。” 它**将焦点从外部成就转移到生活体验的丰富性，转移到旅程本身。**

那么，我为什么会反复回看这个演讲呢？因为它每一次都能重新校准我的视角。它鼓励我拥抱我所选择的道路，不是因为它承诺的目的地，而是因为我喜欢走在这条路上的我。最重要的是，它强化了这样一个理念：喜欢那个正走在这段旅程中的“我”，是我能拥有的最重要的指南针。很多时候，遇到困难了，就会想起，我为什么有走着路，我相信它会让我舍得放弃，排除万难，即使失败也要搞！

# Why, for Dreams, Can People Give Up So Much, Overcome So Many Difficulties, and Try Even if They Fail?

This article discusses my understanding of this video and why I repeatedly watch it and am repeatedly touched by it. This article was created with the assistance of Gemini, which wrote it based on my video notes and transcript, combined with my revisions.

Some talks you watch once and feel grateful for, while others seem to call you back again and again, each viewing revealing new layers of meaning. Teacher Chen's speech at the "Monster Tribe Breaking Boundaries Conference" firmly belongs to the latter category for me. It's not just a speech; it's a mirror reflecting my own journey, a compass when I'm lost, and a powerful reminder of the "why" behind my choices, especially when I make those difficult and misunderstood ones. This isn't just about watching a video; it's about reconnecting with a fundamental truth of living true to oneself.

**The Courage to Write Your Own Story: Liking the "Me" Who Dares to Try**

Teacher Chen started by mentioning his own "heroic moment" of leaving his school job, a story that clearly inspired many, some even to resign because of it! This made me think: "Actually, if I were relatively successful a few years later, looking back at this period of pursuing my dreams, I would definitely feel I was very heroic back then. Not because I truly succeeded—that's only a small factor. The most important thing is that it was a self pursuing dreams, and I like that version of myself." This deeply touched me. This "me" who strives, learns, and builds amidst uncertainty is a "me" I want to support and praise. As I reflect, I realize, "**🎇 The things I accomplish become my story**." I hope it is a narrative of active pursuit.

**The Danger of Forgetting "Why" and the Call of a "Worthy" Path**

The speech then delved into a friend's entrepreneurial dilemma. He felt lost after leaving his job due to unfulfilled promises and unfair treatment. He was troubled by "what if" thoughts and the loss of a large sum of money. Teacher Chen pointedly asked him: "Why did you **leave** in the first place?" The friend's answer was about wanting to create value, needing freedom, like Jobs or Musk. This leads to a crucial insight: "**🎇 The greatest way a person can get lost is to forget their own story**; if they forget their story, they will forget why they set out."

This hits home. When the path is "a unique and difficult road," doubts can creep in. A student asked, "If, after leaving school, you didn't earn as much money and didn't develop as well as before, would you regret it?" When I saw this, I also stopped to think. I thought, it's actually very difficult for me to predict the future right now. If I take this path and it turns out no different from my previous choices, or if I genuinely fail on this path and also sink a lot of costs, will I regret it at that point?

But Teacher Chen skillfully reframes the question: what we choose is "not a simple shortcut to success faster," but a "different road." It's like choosing to go to Jerusalem instead of Rome—not asking which path is faster, but which path is "**more worth walking**." This is faith in your path.

What is the driving force? "**🎇 It is precisely because we have a self we want to become that we endure pain, loss, and challenges, and continuously pursue these things.**" This "pure motive" is the cornerstone.

Additionally, Kazuo Inamori also asked himself for a long time before deciding to start DDI, and then he had a pure motive. Actually, if we have a self we want to become in our hearts, that is a pure motive. In the preface of "A Passion for Success," there's a very tempting sentence that I often recall: "Heaven rewards the diligent. As long as you love your work, hold pure motives and strong desires, and put in effort no less than anyone else, you can move God and receive heavenly assistance. Because this attitude aligns with the way of Heaven and is consistent with the will of the universe." Of course, this doesn't summarize all conditions for success, but it has summarized many important ones.

**Redefining Freedom: My Choices, My Values**

So, what is true freedom? Teacher Chen offers a profound definition: "The essence of freedom is to break free from the old evaluation system, from the evaluation system that the public believes in, and turn towards what you believe is important, and your choices add weight to what you deem important." This is liberation.

He illustrated this with a story from the movie _Millennium Actress_: the protagonist, knowing her pursuit might be futile, declares as she embarks on a dangerous journey, "**Because I like the me who pursues love**." This point really resonates with me: "**🎇 I choose to go to the depths of the universe to find my lover, not fundamentally because I _must_ find him... I do this because I like the me who pursues love; regardless of whether I find him or not, I must do this**." It changed my own internal narrative: "**I do this because I truly want to do it; I like that version of myself, the me who pursues my dreams. Even if there's a high probability of failure, I will still do it.**" Comparing this to my past self, I used to convince myself by saying, "If I don't do this, I'll have regrets; I must try." In contrast, I find the perspective from _Millennium Actress_ is closer to one's original aspiration and more powerful.

When talking about _Millennium Actress_, Teacher Chen also joked using Zhang Jiahao as an example, "I've always wanted to ask Teacher Zhang Jiahao a question, are you under the same kind of spell?" 🤣. After I looked up Zhang Jiahao's story, his persistence is so outrageous, how can it be explained if not by a spell? So this is the power of a role model, a spiritual force, a living force. In life, or in the world, there are actually many such role models and forces, as long as you look and think with an open heart.

> Supplement: A brief introduction to snowboarder Zhang Jiahao.
> He was originally an apprentice pastry chef at a five-star hotel. He fell deeply in love with skiing after encountering it at the age of 17. At 26, he dreamed of participating in the Beijing Winter Olympics. As a non-national team athlete, he spent the previous two years traveling the globe competing for points to get an "entry ticket" to the Olympics. Despite having no professional medical support team or coach, he persisted alone. However, due to the impact of the pandemic, he ultimately failed to meet the points requirement. Nevertheless, with his passion for skiing, he became a commentator for the Winter Olympics skiing events, and his "down-to-earth" yet "immersive" commentary was impressive.

**The Chase Itself Is an Intrinsic Reward**

The video also mentions a student who, despite repeated exam failures and facing the choice of giving up her dreams for comfort, still preferred her anxious yet hopeful and vibrant self. Teacher Chen's advice was: "Then pursue that self that you like. **Because hope and vitality are themselves rewards**." This is so true. The process of striving, learning, and challenging my own boundaries—that energy, that feeling of being alive and engaged, is a reward in itself, regardless of immediate "success."

**Your Greatest Masterpiece: The Time You Have Lived**

Finally, the story shared about the entrepreneur who experienced many ups and downs in life is also very interesting and has sufficient depth. He said: "**Actually, my career, my company, the money I've earned, none of that really matters... My best work is the time I have lived.**" Teacher Chen pointed out that this is something only those who have strived "for the self they wanted to become" can say. My own reaction to this was: "Invincible! ...This can truly resolve a lot of anxiety, entanglement, and low spirits." It **shifts the focus from external achievements to the richness of the lived experience, to the journey itself.**

So, why do I keep returning to this speech? Because it realigns my perspective every single time. It encourages me to embrace the path I've chosen, not for its promised destination, but because I like the me who is walking this path. Most importantly, it reinforces the idea that liking the "me" who is on this journey is the most vital compass I can have. Many times, when I encounter difficulties, I remember why I am on this path. I believe it will make me willing to give things up, overcome all obstacles, and try even if I fail!

As an aside, actually just understanding the principle of this video is still a bit far from making a change. The book "Remarkable Self" contains more feasible methods, which I will share in the future.
